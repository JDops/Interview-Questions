network - group of computers and other devices connected in some ways to be able to exchange data.
devices on network ref to nodes or clients haviung some unique add(ip)
personal area network, localm area network, wide area network , LAN, CAN, Enterprise area network
san--storage area network-high speed network provides access to storage (transfer data),
system area network -uniquely designed for high speed interconnection in a cluster
vpn-lets user send and receive data as devices were connected to private network

OSI Model
conceptual model, communicate using standard protocol
7.Application layer -human computer interaction layer, application access network services eg http,ftp,smtp,dns
6.presentation layer-ensures data is in usable format , encryption &decr
5.session layer- maintain session and responsible for controlling ports and session (setup, cordination and termination between applications)
4.trasport layer- transport data using tcp/udp
3.network layer-decides which physical path the data will take, packet forwarding including routing
2.data link layer -decides format of the data on network. charge of data encapsulation under form of packets
1.physical layer-transmit raw bit stream on physical medium

TCP / IP Model
internet uses for communication
Application Layer- defines the protocol which enables user to interact with the network.ftp, http
Transport Layer-defines how data should flow between hosts.tcp ensures data delivered within hosts in order abd responsible for end-to-end delivery
Internet layer-IP works on this layer, facilitates host addressing and recognition, defines routing
Network-Access Layer -same function 3,2,1 in osi model

-----------------------------
protocol- standardized way of doing certain actions so two and more devices are able to communicate each other
addressing and routing of messages, error detection and recovery
