network - group of computers and other devices connected in some ways to be able to exchange data.
devices on network ref to nodes or clients haviung some unique add(ip)
personal area network, localm area network, wide area network , LAN, CAN, Enterprise area network
san--storage area network-high speed network provides access to storage (transfer data),
system area network -uniquely designed for high speed interconnection in a cluster
vpn-lets user send and receive data as devices were connected to private network

OSI Model
conceptual model, communicate using standard protocol
7.Application layer -human computer interaction layer, application access network services eg http,ftp,smtp,dns
6.presentation layer-ensures data is in usable format , encryption &decr
5.session layer- maintain session and responsible for controlling ports and session (setup, cordination and termination between applications)
4.trasport layer- transport data using tcp/udp
3.network layer-decides which physical path the data will take, packet forwarding including routing
2.data link layer -decides format of the data on network. charge of data encapsulation under form of packets
1.physical layer-transmit raw bit stream on physical medium

TCP / IP Model
internet uses for communication
Application Layer- defines the protocol which enables user to interact with the network.ftp, http
Transport Layer-defines how data should flow between hosts.tcp ensures data delivered within hosts in order abd responsible for end-to-end delivery
Internet layer-IP works on this layer, facilitates host addressing and recognition, defines routing
Network-Access Layer -same function 3,2,1 in osi model

-----------------------------
protocol- standardized way of doing certain actions so two and more devices are able to communicate each other
addressing and routing of messages, error detection and recovery

tcp-used for communicationg over network, divides message into seriesof packets sent from source to dest. ressaembled at dest.
ip-addressing protocol, help in routing through diff nodes until it reaches dest.
udp-for loss tolerating and low-latency links between diff applications
pop-receiving incoming emails
smtp- send and distribute outgoing email
ftp-transfer files from one to another
http-designed for transferring hypertext among 2 or more systems, client-server model
https- encrypted
ssh- secure shell-secure way to access a computer over an unsecured network
dhcp- automate the assignment of ip in a network

tcp-connection oriented means once a connection has been extablished, data can be transmitted in 2 directions.built in system to check for error and guarantee data 
    deliver in order, reliable .feedback mechanism result in large overghead , greater use of available bandwidth
udp- connectionless internet protocol, error-checking and recovery is not-required, data continuously sent whethet received or not

dns -dns resolver , domain converted to ip


class A - 0.0.0.0 to 127.0.0.0           very large networks
class B - 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0       medium or institution sized network
class C - 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.0     home network
class D - 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255
class E - 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255

router- connects 2 or more packet switched networks, managing traffic forwarding data packets to intended ip ,allow multiple device to use same internet
switch- connects devices within a network, forwards data packets to and fro. switch only sends to a single device
firewall-monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic
