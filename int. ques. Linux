initramfs gets corrupted or deleted at the stage of recent OS patching/updates other causes, face kernel panic issue while booting time.

produce o/p --> cd /boot --> rm initramfs.img -->reboot 
kernel panic -- initramfs not found and not syncing --reboot in rescue mode -- cd /boot
#rpmquery kernel
regenerate/ recreate initramfs
1.dracut command -  dracut -f initramfs-3.10.0-1160.el7.x86_64.img initramfs-3.10.0-1160.el7.x86_6
2.mkinitrd command - 
reboot

7. Boot process in linux ?
 BIOS - perform power on self test , handover to 1st sector
 MBR - 1st sector of bootable device has instructions to boot
       load boot loader to memory , handover to it
GRUB- user see GUI , select kernel
       loads kernel and initramfs file and hansover to kernel
kernel -initramfs gets decompressed to load temp file system
        loads driver from temp file to load actual file
        mount partitions , initialize 1st process
systemd - 1st process loaded with PID1 , brings up run level target

8. single user mode in linux - 
e -- rd.break
mount -o remount,rw /sysroot
chroot /sysroot
passwd root  - root
touch /.autorelabel
exit
