1. Shell scripting   - commands in a file, automate it to run

2. Purpose of #!/bin/bash (shebang)?
  os check for the interpreter, execute lines based on the interpreter 
   if no interpreter mentioned, use default interpreter   ... (echo $SHELL)
   cat /etc/shells - check the shells supported 

3. Diff in '[' and '[[' ?
   [ -> internally calls the test command, shell built-in command 
        gives exit code (0-success to 255) non -zero - failure    ... (echo $? --> gives the exit status)
   [[ -> enhanced version --> pattern matching
#shellcheck <script_name>
#shellcheck -s bash <script_name>
#sudo rpm -qa | grep -i shellcheck

Q 4. Write a script to print prime no.?
